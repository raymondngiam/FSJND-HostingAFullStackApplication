### FSJND - Hosting a Full Stack Application

#### Project overview

This project contains workflow to deploy a fullstack app, **Udagram** in AWS with a CI/CD pipeline, <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a>.

We will make use of the AWS console to start and configure the services that the application needs such as 

- a database to store product information, and 

- a web server allowing the site to be discovered by potential customers.

The frontend of the deployed app, **Udagram** can be accessed at: http://fsjndudagrambucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
